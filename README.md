# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Lauren, and I am a young graduate passionate about applying analytical techniques to different data-driven approaches. Please see below for a few facts about me!

## 📚 Education & Employment:
- **University of Notre Dame:** Class of 2025
- **Major:** Applied Computational Math and Statistics
- **Minor:** Data Science
- Following my graduation, I will be joining Traveler's as an associate analyst on a quantitative track!

## 📌 Current Projects:
This past semester, I just finished working on:
- **Developing a data science portfolio** - This portfolio showcases different skills from basic data exploration to advanced modeling and devloping user interfaces. Find my portfolio [here](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio) if you're interested!
- **Exploring the social implications of data** - As insightful as data science can be, it is also important to analyze the risk of missing or biased data, where it occurs, and how to raise awareness. Find an example of how I intersected my data science skills with these concepts [here](https://github.com/llatimer031/Data-Feminism-App).
- **Participating in cardiovascular modeling research** - This research uses Python to analyze hemodynamic data that compares flow dynamics across healthy and diseased aortas to better understand the modeling of cardiovascular function.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills:
- **Programming languages:** Python, R, MatLab, Unix
- **Software packages:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit
- **Tools:** Excel, LaTeX
  
## 🎯 Goals:
- Continue to develop new data visualization techniques, such as building interactive platforms on Tableau or Power BI.
- Enhance my data storytelling abilities, promoting effective communication at all stages of the data analysis process, from exploration to deliverables.
- Learn to implement existing skills in new fields as I begin a new career.
